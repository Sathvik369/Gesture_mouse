This project utilizes the power of Python libraries mediapipe and pyautogui to create a virtual mouse controlled by hand gestures captured through your webcam. 
Move the cursor by tracking your hand movements with the webcam.
Define custom gestures for specific actions like clicking, dragging, or scrolling. 

This is a basic implementation and may require calibration depending on your webcam and lighting conditions.
Advanced features like custom gestures and cross-platform compatibility are optional and may need further development.
